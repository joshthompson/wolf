# Wolf

Wolf is a social game built using node and web sockets based off Werewolves/Mafia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game))

It allows you to host from one browswer window and then have every player connect with a game code and their phones (or any device that has a browser). Host browser then runs game for you removing the need for a narrator and allowing more complicated character classes and abilities.

## Project

The project is in early stages so currently is not playable but once it is I will put a link to a hosted version.

## Install

Make sure you have node and npm installed

Run `npm install`

In one terminal window run `npm run build`

In a second terminal run `npm run start`

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in a modern browser
